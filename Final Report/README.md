# Final Report


The Final Report is an accumulation of all three previous reports: paper design, progress report 1 and progress report 2. It is structured as follows:

- A Requirement Analysis: where requirement, specifications and acceptance test
protocols are derived from the projectâ€™s description.
- A Paper Design: where a theoretical version of the project was proposed by explor-
ing the background, feasibility, possible bottlenecks, available algorithms choices,
subsystem design and experimental design.
- A Validation using Simulated Data (Progress Report 01): or simulated imple-
mentation of the project where sample data is used in a data analysis, simulated
experiment, results and re-evaluated acceptance test procedures.
- A Validation using IMU Data (Progress Report 02): or practical implementation
of the project where data is retrieved from the IMU is used in a IMU module
for data validation, practical experiment, results and re-evaluated acceptance test
procedures.
- A conclusion and plan for future work.
