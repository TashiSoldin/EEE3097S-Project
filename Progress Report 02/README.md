# Progress Report 02


The Progress Report 2 states the practical focused experiment or hardware implementation. It includes:

- An IMU module which compares the provided IMU sensor with the one the project is intended to use as well as hardware and sensor validation tests and results to ensure proper operation of the sensor and thus correct data retrieval.
- An experiment setup where the overall system as well as practical C programs are tested to ensure they meet the projects requirements and corresponding specifications.
- Results were collected from the experiment and discussed
- Acceptance test procedures were decided to be met or not depending on the results of the experiment.
