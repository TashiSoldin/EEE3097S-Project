# Paper Design

The Paper Design details the preliminary, theoretical planning of the project. This report includes:

- A requirement analysis where requirements are derived from the project's description and corresponding specifications are drawn. This also includes user cases, possible bottlenecks, a feasibility analysis and comparison of available compression and encryption algorithms.
- A subsystem design where the project was broken into subsystems and sub-subsystems and specific requirements and specifications were derived for them. This also includes a UML diagram and experiment design which outlines how future implementations will tested to ensure proper working.
- Acceptance test procedures were derived for each requirement and specification par which illustrate how each will be tested to proved proper functionality.
- Development timeline was created showing the plan for the project.
